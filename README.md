# Node-Based App

This is a simple node-based desktop application built with **Java** and **JavaFX**. It allows you to build small computation graphs by connecting different types of nodes together. The system is modular and designed for experimentation with numeric and boolean operations through visual node connections.

## ✨ Features

- **Visual Node System**: Create and connect nodes to build custom computation graphs.
  
### 🧮 Math Nodes
- **Constant** – Outputs a fixed double value.  
- **Adder** – Takes two numerical inputs and outputs their sum.  
- **Display** – Displays a numeric input value.  

### 🔘 Boolean Nodes
- **Boolean Constant** – Outputs a static `true` or `false` value.  

> 💡 Currently, only the nodes listed above are implemented.

## 🚀 Planned Features

Future versions will include many more powerful node types, such as:

- 🔗 API request nodes  
- 🔤 String manipulation nodes  
- 🖼️ Image manipulation nodes  
- ⚙️ Additional math and boolean logic  
- 💾 Saving/loading node graphs  
- 🧩 Custom node creation support  

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Java 17+**
- **JavaFX**

## 🔧 Getting Started
